Pull a File from GitHub:
To pull a file from GitHub instead of importing a local file, you can use the requests library to fetch the file from a GitHub URL. First, you'll need to install the requests library if you haven't already (you can install it using pip install requests). Then, modify your code to download the file from GitHub:

import requests

# Function to fetch a file from a GitHub URL
def fetch_github_file(github_url, local_path):
    response = requests.get(github_url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        with open(local_path, 'wb') as file:
            file.write(response.content)

# Example usage:
github_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repo/main/data.csv'
local_path = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], 'data.csv')
fetch_github_file(github_url, local_path)


Specific Student IDs:
If you want to filter the data based on specific student IDs, you can add code to filter the data by student ID. Modify your index function to include a list of specific student IDs, and then filter the data list based on those IDs before rendering the template.

Here's an example of how to do this:

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    data = []  # A list to hold our CSV data
    specific_student_ids = ['12345', '67890']  # List of specific student IDs you want to filter

    if request.method == 'POST' and 'csv' in request.files:
        # ... (Your existing code for uploading and reading the CSV file)

        # Filter the data based on specific student IDs
        data = [row for row in data if row[0] in specific_student_ids]

    return render_template('index.html', data=data)
