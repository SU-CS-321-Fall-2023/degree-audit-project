# Smart Degree Audit

    Start Date: September 1, 2023

Rundown: Automatically generate semester-by-semester schedules based on user interests and degree requirements.

This project aims to expand upon the current functionality (or lack thereof) of Stetson University's Degree Audit. We also understand that overwhelming feeling of looking at your Degree Audit and trying to figure out how to fit everything that you need and want into a (realistic) schedule. We also understand the feeling of creating your "perfect" schedule only to find out that one of the courses requires a prerequisite. We seek to address these struggles by expanding upon Degree Audit to create lateral schedules that account for your expressed interests, requirements for your major(s) and, if applicable, minor(s), and fitting in the necessary prerequisites. It gets better: we plan to implement functionality that creates multiple versions of schedules, or, at the very least, points out which courses are interchangeable in their order.
