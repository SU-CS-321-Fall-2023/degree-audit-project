                    The Auditors are truly inspirational individuals that strive to address the issues that we all face.
                    Stetson Clay Target Team is a competitive shotgun shooting team that competes in American Trap, 
                    American Skeet, and Sporting Clays. However, recreational shooters are also welcome; we are open to all 
                    Stetson students and staff/faculty, both men and women.
                </p>
                <p id="About_Paragraph_2">
                    No prior experience with shotguns or clay target shooting is necessary to join. We provide fun and safe 
                    opportunities for members who have never fired a shotgun before, intermediate shooters, and the most advanced 
                    shooters. Our main goal is to exhibit and promote firearm safety while enjoying our favorite sport!
                </p>
                <p id="About_Paragraph_3">
                    Additionally, the Clay Target Team is not simply about gaining the opportunity to fire a shotgun, it provides 
                    the opportunity to connect and work with terrific members of Stetson faculty, city officials, and engaged 
                    community members.
